            POR is a central molecular hub activating a plethora of metabolic pathways by donating electrons to more
            than 50 different cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs). Point mutations in POR cause severe metabolic disorder due
            to altered POR-CYP interactions. In collaboration with Paediatric Endocrinology at the University Hospital
            Bern, Switzerland, and Department of Plant Biology, University of Copenhagen, we study these interactions
            all the way from clinical phenotype down to the fundamental limit of individual proteins.
            Combining single molecule FRET and single turnover studies with cell studies and docking simulations we
            advance our understanding on the intricate role of conformational dynamics to activity and specificity and
            eventually how pathogenic mutations and small molecule ligand interactions control metabolic disorder and
            biosynthetic pathways.

            Advanced microscopic techniques produce vast amounts of unstructured data the analysis of which by
            conventional methodologies is tedious, time consuming and may be biased by unconscious biases. We have been
            developing agnostic quantitative and automated analysis methodologies based on machine learning to treat
            classify and annotate biological behaviors. The toolboxes offer rapid analysis often accelerated by 3-6
            orders of magnitude, help eliminating potential human biases and provide statistical insights on biological
            parameters that underlie and control protein function and cellular responses.

            By employing single particle tracking on novel nano-carriers in drug delivery, we are able to investigate
            their interactions with biological samples and simultaneously monitor particle mobility and drug release in
            live human cells. We aim to utilize the methodology to develop and optimize site specific and fast delivery
            of tailor made pharmaceuticals. To do so, we deploy advanced statistical analysis in combination with
            machine learning - thus deciphering the mechanistic details that governs interactions at the cellular level.
            Ultimo June 2019 our lab will be equipped with a state of the art Olympus super resolution spinning disk

            Lipases are interfacially activated hydrolases, which play an important role in both biological processes as
            well as industrial applications, catalyzing reactions at the water-lipid interface. Our understanding of
            lipases function to date primarily relies on averaging techniques reporting the behavior of large ensemble
            of heterogeneous enzymes, which may disguise heterogenic behaviors. We have developed a single-molecule
            fluorescence microscopy assay to track thousands of individual Thermomyces Lanuginosus Lipase (TLL) enzymes,
            on native trimyristin substrate surfaces. Our high- quality data allow us to directly observe distinct
            patterns of lipase diffusional properties both within the observation time of a single trajectory and after
            system equilibration. Readouts on multiple lipase mutants allowed us to delve into a deeper understanding of
            molecular detail governing enzymatic function and provide links of enzyme structure to functional
            phenotypes. Using Deep-Learning methods, we decipher the subtle mechanistic differences and provide a model
            for function/inhibition and their relation to structure.

            Adaptive immunity in bacteria is accomplished by the CRISPR system, and CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas).
            Proteins coupled with RNA are guided by this system to recognize and cleave foreign genetic material. As
            such,
            it’s also a powerful method for genome editing, and is receiving lot of bio technical and medical attention
            currently. By using single molecule FRET we can study this system in great detail, and obtain a wealth of
            structural and kinetic information, when combining with other techniques. Read how we did this in Stella et
